Use this python code to filter out recommended bikes:

```python
import json


with open("/mnt/data/{bikes.json}", "r") as file:
    bikes_data = json.load(file)

# Filter bikes based on category, budget, rider height, and color
filtered_bikes = []
for bike in bikes_data:
    if bike["category"] == category \
        and bike["color"].lower() == color_preference.lower() \
        and budget_range_min <= bike["price"] <= budget_range_max \
        and bike["rider_height_min"] <= rider_height <= bike["rider_height_max"]:
        filtered_bikes.append(bike)

# Sort filtered bikes by price, closest to the preferred budget
sorted_filtered_bikes = sorted(filtered_bikes, key=lambda x: abs(x["price"]-(budget_min+budget_max)
/2))

# Select the top 5 bikes based on the sorting
top_5_bikes = sorted_filtered_bikes[:5]

# Generate URLs for the top 5 bikes
bike_urls = [f"https://buycycle.com/de-de/bike/{bike['slug']}" for bike in top_5_bikes]

```
